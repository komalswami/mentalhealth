<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
    The teen years can be extremely tough and depression affects teenagers far more often than many of us realize. In fact, it’s estimated that one in five adolescents from all walks of life will suffer from depression at some point during their teen years. However, while depression is highly treatable, most depressed teens never receive help.
    Teen depression goes beyond moodiness. It’s a serious health problem that impacts every aspect of a teen’s life. Fortunately, it’s treatable and parents can help. Your love, guidance, and support can go a long way toward helping your teen overcome depression and get their life back on track.

<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">While occasional bad moods or acting out is to be expected during the teenage years, depression is something different. The negative effects of teenage depression go far beyond a melancholy mood. Depression can destroy the essence of your teen’s personality, causing an overwhelming sense of sadness, despair, or anger. Many rebellious and unhealthy behaviors or attitudes in teenagers can be indications of depression. The following are some the ways in which teens “act out” in an attempt to cope with their emotional pain:.</p>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
<b>
Problems at school.</b><br/> Depression can cause low energy and concentration difficulties. At school, this may lead to poor attendance, a drop in grades, or frustration with schoolwork in a formerly good student.
</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
                       <br/>
Running away.</b><br/> Many depressed teens run away from home or talk about running away. Such attempts are usually a cry for help.

<b>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
       <br/>
       Drug and alcohol abuse.</b><br/> Teens may use alcohol or drugs in an attempt to self-medicate their depression. Unfortunately, substance abuse only makes things worse.

    </p>



<b>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
       <br/>
       Low self-esteem. </b><br/> Depression can trigger and intensify feelings of ugliness, shame, failure, and unworthiness.

    </p>



<b>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
       <br/>
       Smartphone addiction.</b><br/> Teens may go online to escape their problems, but excessive smartphone and Internet use only increases their isolation, making them more depressed.

    </p>


<b>
    <p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
       <br/>
       Violence.</b><br/> Depressed teens may engage in dangerous or high-risk behaviors, such as reckless driving, binge drinking, and unsafe sex.

    </p>

           Reckless behavior.</b><br/> Some depressed teens—usually boys who are the victims of bullying—can become aggressive and violent.

<p>Depression is very damaging when left untreated, so don’t wait and hope that worrisome symptoms will go away. If you suspect that your teen is depressed, bring up your concerns in a loving, non-judgmental way. Even if you’re unsure that depression is the issue, the troublesome behaviors and emotions you’re seeing are signs of a problem that should be addressed.

    Open up a dialogue by letting your teen know what specific depression symptoms you’ve noticed and why they worry you. Then ask your child to share what they’re going through—and be ready and willing to truly listen. Hold back from asking a lot of questions (most teenagers don’t like to feel patronized or crowded), but make it clear that you’re ready and willing to provide whatever support they need..</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center;">How to communicate with a depressed teen</h1>

<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
<b>
    Focus on listening, not lecturing.</b><br/>Resist any urge to criticize or pass judgment once your teenager begins to talk. The important thing is that your child is communicating. You’ll do the most good by simply letting your teen know that you’re there for them, fully and unconditionally.
</p>                   

<b>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
   <br/>
   Be gentle but persistent</b><br/>  Don’t give up if they shut you out at first. Talking about depression can be very tough for teens. Even if they want to, they may have a hard time expressing what they’re feeling. Be respectful of your child’s comfort level while still emphasizing your concern and willingness to listen.

</p>



<b>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
<br/>
Acknowledge their feelings.</b><br/>  Don’t try to talk your teen out of depression, even if their feelings or concerns appear silly or irrational to you. Well-meaning attempts to explain why “things aren’t that bad” will just come across as if you don’t take their emotions seriously. Simply acknowledging the pain and sadness they are experiencing can go a long way in making them feel understood and supported.

</p>



<b>
<p class="lead" style="text-align: center;">
<br/>
Trust your gut </b><br/>  If your teen claims nothing is wrong but has no explanation for what is causing the depressed behavior, you should trust your instincts. If your teen won’t open up to you, consider turning to a trusted third party: a school counselor, favorite teacher, or a mental health professional. The important thing is to get them talking to someone.
